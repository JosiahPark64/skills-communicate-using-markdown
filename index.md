## Advanced Formatting Reference
[Advanced Formatting from Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting)

## Text Manipulation
sample text
**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*
~~Strikethrough text~~
**Bold and _Italic_ Text**
***All bold and Italic***
This is <sub>subscript</sub> text
This is <sup>superscript</sup> text
<ins>This is underlined</ins>

> quoted text
asdfds `quote` using ctrl+e hotkeys adds a block of code within markdown
> 
## color models
Supported color models are HEX, RGB, HSL
> #RRGGBB
> rgb(R,G,B)
> hsl(H,S,L)

This is HEX `#0969DA`, This is RBG `rbg(9,105,218`, This is HSL `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`

## Links
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
ctrl+k is the hotkey for the formatting
Text in the brackets [] will be the hyperlink, text in the parenthesis () is the link.

## Section link

Letters are converted to lower-case.
> Spaces are replaced by hyphens (-). Any other whitespace or punctuation characters are removed.
> Leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
> Markup formatting is removed, leaving only the contents (for example, _italics_ becomes italics).
> If the automatically generated anchor for a heading is identical to an earlier anchor in the same document, a unique identifier is generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer.

## Relative Links
using the same formatting I can link to another file relative to the repository.
Don't forget `/` is relative to the repository root
`./` and `../` are relative link operands
This is very useful when others are cloning the repository

## Custom Anchors
declare the anchor with this syntax
<a name="my-custom-anchor-point"></a>
Some text I want to provide a direct link to, but which doesn't have its own heading.
[A link to that custom anchor](#my-custom-anchor-point)

## Line Breaks
Accomplish line break with two spaces  
at the end of the first line\
or a backslash at the end of the first line<br/>
or an HTML single line break tag at the end of the line

or a blank line between two lines will be rendered as double spacing

## Hiding Content with comments
<!-- this content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->

Tell github to ignore (or escape) markdown formatting by using \ before the markdown character
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*
